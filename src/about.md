I know for sure that programming itâ€™s my true passion, I want to write code every day until the last day of my life.

I like to write clean and readable code, I practice TDD when I think it makes sense, but I always write tests (back-end and front-end), be it before or after implementation code.

Refactoring code to keep it decoupled and easily maintainable it's what I enjoy the most of the development process, trying whenever possible to extract a library here or there that could be useful for the Open Source community.

I am a full stack web developer, I build web applications from scratch, from database design, through back-end logic, until front-end work, I can seamlessly work in any feature from end to end.
